Within this folder you find versions of the mss tools, written by Tim
Minto, Minto Spatial Solutions.

You'll find the Releases
* mss_41_20080802
* mss_41_20090519
* mss_411_20090519
* mss_411_20090810
* mss_411_20100907
* mss_420_20110425
as single revisions of trunk. Each last version the CST releases I've
also tagged: 
* mss_41_20090519
* mss_411_20100907
* mss_420_20110425
The Code of these should be identical to what you'll find at
sourceforge.net/projects/magikcmpnts/ 

Up to now the development of the mss tools as whole ends up with that
mss_420_20110425 release. 

In our environment we are using the Pointing Rules (ptrules) part of
the mss tools, and we are using CST 4.3.0. So I was in the need of
maintaining the ptrule-part of mss. The newer revisions on trunk are
updates for the ptrules Part only. ALL OTHER PARTS ARE STILL ON CST
4.2(0) level and are very likely not to work without changes! 

The revisions I've published here are:
* mss_430_20130716-ptrules-only (no functional changes,      tested against CST TSB 4.3.0.1)
* mss_430_20130912-ptrules-only (some functional changes,    tested against CST TSB 4.3.0.1)
* mss_430_20150219-ptrules-only (one method deprecated,      tested against CST TSB 4.3.0.6)
* mss_430_20150908-ptrules-only (one core change made more specific, 
                                                             tested against CST TSB 4.3.0.6)
* mss_430_20150909-ptrules-only (one more method deprecated, tested against CST TSB 4.3.0.6)

If you are using CST 4.3.0 and you want to use other functionality
than the ptrules, you are encouraged to upgrade the needed parts of
the mss tools: It might happen that Tim will not do it before he
retires, but you may ask him, of course.
