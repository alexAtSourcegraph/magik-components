Release notes for MSS V4.3.0 2015.09.09:

This release is intended entirely as an upgrade to MSS V4.2.0 2011.04.25, for
compatibility with Smallworld Core Spatial Technology V4.3.0 including
Technical Support Bulletin 4.3.0.6. Developers, who want to use this
release together with a CST TSB level lower than 4.3.0.3, should at
least integrate P150766_1b.magik into the image.

Functional changes:
- mss_ptrule_attribute_dialog now handles non-text join fields in the
  same way as physical fields. Previous behaviour has been propably
  incorrect in most cases.
- mss_ptrule mandatory attribute check is done for join fields as well
- If an embedded object editor is behind another window in the tab
  box (such as object control) TM's change to the editor_manager
  prevented the embedded editor to update to any changed
  record_selection. Now the change is restricted to cases, when on the
  databus together with the record selection also a geom_set is given,
  which is likely to be the case only, if the current selection of the
  current map is changed. So now (like in CST standard) other plugins
  may change the embedded editor's content, even if it is not on top.

Developers who are upgrading from any previous version are strongly encouraged to
perform a source code comparison relative to that previous version, in order to
understand any relevant upgrade code changes, and to ensure that any local
customizations are properly re-integrated where appropriate.


MSS_BULK_UPDATE modules:

not yet upgraded from V4.2

MSS_COMMON modules:

mss_core_changes
- geometry_set_factory.get_application_world_for_world(): removed,
  basic change no longer required. 

mss_swaf_changes
- map.note_change(): integrated with V4.3.0 changes.
- map_trail.probe_from(): integrated with V4.3.0 changes.
- layout_plugin.mss_start_layout_designer(): deprecated as the code
  base has been changed with CST TSB 4.3.0.2 and on the other hand the
  method is not needed for the currently only supported functionality
  of mss_ptrules. Nevertheless the new version is compatible with the
  changed code base.

mss_user_object_editor
- editor_manager.sw_databus_data_available()
  dynamic !edit_from_record_selection?! change to
  !edit_from_map_selection?! and set to _true only, if geom_selection
  isnt empty
- editor_manager.update_viewers()
  dynamic !edit_from_record_selection?! change to
  !edit_from_map_selection?!
- mss_user_rwo_specials_plugin.show_special_actions(): 
  integrated with CST TSB 4.3.0.3 changes. Subclassing will be removed
  in future release
- sw_component.mss_user_rwo_specials_actions(): classified as
  deprecated. Developers who have customized this method should move
  customizations to editor_plugin.special_action_names instead, which is part
  of CST TSB 4.3.0.3. 

MSS_CU modules:

not yet upgraded from V4.2

MSS_HTTP modules:

not yet upgraded from V4.2

MSS_PTRULES modules:

mss_ptrule_construction_manager
- mss_ptrule_construction_plugin.manage_actions_for_trail(): changed,
  taking into account, that since V4.3.0
  map_manager.sw_databus_data_requested(:map_trail) now may yield
  {_unset,_unset} instead of {}
- mss_ptrule_construction_plugin.manage_actions_for_selection(): changed,
  taking into account, that since V4.3.0
  map_manager.sw_databus_data_requested(:map_selection) now may yield
  {_unset,{}} instead of {}

mss_ptrule_attribute_dialog
- mss_ptrule_attribute_dialog.update_current_detached_record():
  changed for correct handling of non text join fields
- mss_ptrule_attribute_dialog.work_record(): changed for correct

RELEASE_PATCHES

not yet upgraded from V4.2

source
- case_ds_view.archive_data_model(): integrated with V4.2.0 changes.  (Note: this
  is not part of regularly-compiled MSS code; it is compiled on-demand so that
  CASE archives get created with a more regular ordering of objects, to facilitate
  source code compares).

MSS_CAMBRIDGE_DEMO modules:

not yet upgraded from V4.2
