 tested against v410 and v430

rd_mss
 rd_mss_ptrules_nrm_compatibility 
  a glue code module for usage of mss ptrules together with nrm 
  tested against v410

 patches for v410 and v430 which you might or not find useful. There
 is a short description within the patch_list.txt but none is
 activated. They are custom_patches in the sense of the
 'dynamic_patching_engine' module provided by the NRMB layered
 product. But even if you don't youse NRMB you should be easily be
 able to adept them to your needs.
